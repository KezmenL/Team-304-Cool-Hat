“Doing some work under the southwest desert sun 8+ hours a day, 5 days a week, rugged terrain, this hat is keeping my fair skin safe, and fitscomfortably on my big head. I have had it about 2 months now, it has been washed at laundromat every week (and it gets super dirty), and it is holding up great. Strongly recommend for anyone!”

“Hat is listed as unisex. I ordered two, one for myself and one for my wife. The hat is too big for me and my wife's is way too big. The adjustment is insufficient to make any amount of adjustment. I would not recommend this had because of the adjustment, but I did not like it overall.
The second hat came from a third source (different color) and was folded which creased the bill.”

“It is super reliable , to be honest I stopped charging it the week after I got it . I work outside and the solar panels constantly receive direct sunlight . Bigger visor protects from the sun on all sides . Definitely would recommend if you work in direct sunlight . Shipping did take a little long but it is very well made . Worth the money in my opinion as I use it daily .”

Looks worse in person than in the picture. My average (7 1/2 hat size) head swims in this so the brim blocks my visitor. The fans don’t really cool the head/face.

“These hats are great! I have 3 now but their showing their age after I've replaced the batteries. I wear them almost exclusively. Sometimes you don't know when your going to need lite and I'm always impressed with how smart I am to be wearing this hat with the lights on it! Lol Simply beautiful. Why didn't they always have these. I'm throwing my other hats away because I've been disappointed ANY night I didn't have them on. “

“There are only two LITTLE lights, not four, and they are very dim. The only thing they would be good for is finding your way along an unlit path at night. Otherwise, the hat is well-made, looks like it will last, but that isn't what I bought it for. “

Great idea, allows for doing a lot of things hands-free while keeping the sun/rain off. Keep in mind that it has the weight and underside structure of an umbrella, not a hat, and the bars(?) that hold it up end at the headband, so you can feel them moving on your head a bit. It's probably not something that would be comfortable for hours on end, but it's great for an hour or so.
The hat allows for hands free use.

I like the size of the umbrella hat. However, it’s very hard to put and stay on your head. Also it’s very flimsy. I cut my fingers on the sharp metal bars that provide the little support there is. The metal needs to be filed or sanded down to prevent the sharp cuts to your fingers. I
Durable design. (Latent)


Well secured on head and aerodynamic, (won’t blow away) .

Safe design and materials with no sharp edges.
