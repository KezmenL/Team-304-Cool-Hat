# Cool Cap Project

## Introduction

The Cool Cap is designed to provide a comfortable and stylish way to stay cool in hot weather. The cap is made from lightweight and breathable materials that wick away moisture
and keep the user's head cool. It's equipped with a built-in fan that circulates air around the user's head, providing additional cooling. Furthermore, the cap features a motor-driven
brim that can detect sunlight and move to block it. Users can also control the cap via Wi-Fi for added convenience.

## Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to create a motor-driven hat designed to provide shade to the user's face and neck by automatically moving to block the sun. 
To achieve this, the hat is equipped with a motor that adjusts the brim in response to the sun's position. The hat is powered by a rechargeable battery and can be controlled 
via a Wi-Fi-enabled device. Please refer to the product requirements document for a complete list of features and functionalities that must be included in the product release.
